# Cosplay (Front-end)

We therefore decided to go on a mobile application of "Multi-use social network intended for the community of Cosplayers" which brings together several services including:

- Sharing of content, photos, videos of cosplays (DIY sharing).
- Private sale of accessories or costumes.
- Sharing of upcoming events, information point.

It's an React-Native application  in relation with an NodeJS API . https://github.com/ProjectSocialCosplay/BackSocialCosplay


### Status of the projet

Cosplay is a project under development, for the moment, for V1, only the social network part is available, it is possible to create an account, share content, follow your friends.

Following the health measures, we decided to put the sharing of events on hold, because groups of more than 10 people are still prohibited, however this part has been coded and could be implemented later.

Finally, we have not yet had time to start the private sales from person to person, but this subject has been carefully considered and will be implemented later.
